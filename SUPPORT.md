# Instructions for Logging Issues

## 1. Search for Duplicates

[Search the existing issues](https://github.com/microsoft/ace-ux-components/issues) before logging a new one.

## 2. Do you have a question?

The issue tracker is for **issues**, in other words, bugs and suggestions.
If you have a _question_, _feedback_ or _suggestions_, please contact our team at
aceuxcomponentscrew@microsoft.com

In general, things we find useful when reviewing suggestions are:

- A description of the problem you're trying to solve
- An overview of the suggested solution
- Examples of how the suggestion would work in various places
  - Code examples showing e.g. "this would be an error, this wouldn't"
  - Code examples showing the generated Typescript (if applicable)
- If relevant, precedent in other languages can be useful for establishing context and expected behavior

## 3. Did you find a bug?

When logging a bug, please be sure to include the following:

- Which sample and in what programming language
- If at all possible, an _isolated_ way to reproduce the behavior
- The behavior you expect to see, and the actual behavior
